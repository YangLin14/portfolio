                    <p class="experience-overview">
                        During my 12-week internship at Ubitus K.K., I joined
                        the Terminal Device Group (TDG) working across web
                        frontend, 3D, and CNF (Console and Frontier) teams. This
                        transformative experience involved developing
                        cutting-edge AI infrastructure solutions, from semantic
                        search optimization to company-wide security frameworks,
                        while gaining profound insights into engineering
                        philosophy and problem-solving approaches.
                    </p>

                    <section id="overview">
                        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                        <p>
                            My primary focus was developing a Model Context
                            Protocol (MCP) server to enable UbiGPT, the
                            company's large language model, to perform accurate
                            and efficient semantic searches across multiple
                            Milvus vector database collections. The project
                            evolved through three distinct phases, each building
                            upon the previous to create a comprehensive solution
                            that achieved a 77.8% F1 Score.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond the core MCP project, I architected a
                            company-wide prompt injection defense framework and
                            served as the primary technical operator for the G1
                            humanoid robot at the AI WAVE exhibition, providing
                            a well-rounded experience in AI development,
                            security, and real-world applications.

                    <section id="phase1">
                        <h2>Phase 1: MCP Server Foundation</h2>
                        <p>
                            The journey began with inheriting and transforming a
                            coworker's database search algorithm from
                            <code>milvus_memory.py</code> into a robust,
                            containerized MCP server. This foundational work
                            established the groundwork for all subsequent
                            enhancements.
                        </p>

                        <h3>System Architecture Development</h3>
                        <p>
                            Designed and built a Python-based MCP server to act
                            as middleware between the UbiGPT LLM and the Milvus
                            vector database. The architecture required careful
                            consideration of connection stability, data
                            formatting, and error handling to ensure reliable
                            operation in a production environment.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Key Technical Achievements</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Successfully containerized the existing database
                                search script using Docker
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Established stable connection checks and
                                consistent aliasing for MilvusDB
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Engineered data standardization, transforming
                                returned document format from a list of
                                dictionaries into structured JSON strings
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Implemented robust error handling and logging
                                mechanisms
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Created comprehensive documentation for future
                                maintenance and scaling
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            This phase laid the critical groundwork for single
                            collection searches while designing the system with
                            extensibility in mind for future cross-collection
                            capabilities.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Phase 2: Cross-Collection Search Architecture</h2>
                        <p>
                            The most intellectually challenging phase involved
                            enabling searches across multiple database
                            collections. This required innovative thinking about
                            how to balance LLM cognitive load, system
                            performance, and search accuracy.

                                    Initially considered searching all
                                    collections simultaneously but proactively
                                    discarded this approach after identifying
                                    significant performance bottlenecks and
                                    resource consumption issues.

                                    Developed a sophisticated system providing
                                    the LLM with three discrete tools:
                                    <code>list_collections</code>,
                                    <code>list_schemas</code>, and
                                    <code>search</code>. This enabled agentic
                                    discovery and step-by-step query processing,
                                    giving the LLM maximum flexibility in
                                    determining search strategies.

                                    all collections and schemas. This approach
                                    reduced cognitive load on the LLM while
                                    maintaining search effectiveness and

                        <p>
                            The "One Tool" approach involved creating
                            intelligent abstractions that combined collection
                            metadata with schema information into easily
                            digestible formats for the LLM. This required
                            careful consideration of information density,
                            relevance filtering, and presentation formatting to
                            optimize LLM comprehension without overwhelming the
                            context window.

                    <section id="phase3">
                        <h2>Phase 3: Search Result Optimization</h2>
                        <p>
                            The final phase focused on dramatically improving
                            search accuracy by transitioning from basic distance
                            metrics to sophisticated semantic analysis
                            techniques.
                        </p>

                        <h3>From L2 Distance to Re-ranking Models</h3>
                        <p>
                            Initially, the system relied on L2 (Euclidean)
                            distance for filtering search results. While
                            computationally efficient, this approach often
                            missed semantically relevant results that didn't
                            align perfectly in vector space. The transition to
                            re-ranking models represented a significant leap in
                            search quality.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Re-ranking Implementation</h3>
                        <p>
                            Leveraged advanced re-ranking models to analyze
                            semantic relevance between raw user query text and
                            retrieved documents. This approach considers
                            contextual meaning, synonyms, and conceptual

                            architecture to critique and refine outputs from the
                            generation agent, potentially reducing errors
                            without significant time costs. Additionally,
                            identified opportunities for implementing UV for
                            better Python environment management across the
                            organization.

                        <h2>Mentorship & Philosophical Growth</h2>
                        <p>
                            Beyond technical achievements, this internship
                            provided profound personal and philosophical growth
                            through mentorship from Vic Chung and Melody Wang,
                            whose insights fundamentally shaped my understanding
                            of engineering and problem-solving.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Engineering Philosophy</h3>
                        <p>
                            My mentors taught me that engineering transcends
                            mere coding—it's fundamentally about
                            problem-solving. As they eloquently explained,
                            "coding is just
                            描述事情的邏輯，是將邏輯具象化的工具" (coding is
                            merely describing logic and making logic concrete).
                            This perspective shift helped me understand that
                            finding the right people to solve problems is as
                            valuable as solving them yourself.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Profound Conversations</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our discussions explored deep philosophical

                                spiritual dimensions)

                        <h3>Transformative Impact</h3>
                        <p>
                            These conversations were very worth continuing to
                            think about deeply. They fundamentally changed my
                            approach to engineering challenges, encouraging me
                            to think holistically about systems, their purpose,
                            and their impact on human experience.
                        </p>

                            This 12-week experience has been characterized as
                            "the most memorial experience in my life," with
                            lessons and perspectives that will be carried
                            forward into all future engineering endeavors. The

                        <h2>Project Continuity & Future Improvements</h2>
                        <p>
                            During the final weeks of the internship, I enhanced
                            the MCP server by migrating from stdio to
                            streamable-http architecture, significantly
                            improving calling efficiency and preparing the
                            system for production-scale deployment.
                            Additionally, I proposed using UV for enhanced
                            Python environment management across the
                            organization, demonstrating ongoing commitment to
                            system optimization and developer experience
                            improvements.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The experience culminated in presenting my work to
                            the 16-person TDG team during the 8th week, sharing
                            both technical achievements and lessons learned with
                            colleagues who will continue building upon this
                            foundation.
